-- Seed script: Create default admin user
-- Note: This is a placeholder. For production, use the Node.js seed script
-- (database/seeds/seed-admin.js) which properly hashes the password.
--
-- To create admin user with proper password hashing, run:
--   node database/seeds/seed-admin.js
--
-- Or after the application is running, you can create the user through the API/UI

-- This SQL file is kept for reference but the Node.js script is recommended
-- as it properly hashes the password using bcrypt

-- Default credentials (MUST be changed after first login):
-- Username: admin
-- Password: admin123

-- The password hash below is a placeholder and will not work.
-- Use the Node.js seed script instead for proper password hashing.
